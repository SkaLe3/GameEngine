# StillAlive
StillAlive is a 2D roguelike game made from scratch within the pet project.

This pet project was developed for educational purposes to gain knowledge about the operation of game engines and experience in game development.

Engine:
I was interested in developing the game from scratch, so I didn't use an off-the-shelf engine. The engine on which the game is made is based on the Hazel engine owned by The Cherno Studio https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel. During my training, I coded the engine from scratch by watching Cherno videos and learning it and repeating the things I needed with own changes. Unlike Hazel, this engine uses SFML instead of OpenGL to make the task easier and make more difference for now. Also there will be OpenGL usage in the future in order to learn graphics API.

Still Alive:
The game is completely developed by me.
