# Engine:
I was interested in developing the game from scratch, so I didn't use an off-the-shelf engine. The engine on which the game is made is based on the Hazel engine owned by The Cherno Studio https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel. During my training, I coded the engine from scratch by watching Cherno videos and learning it and repeating the things I needed with small own changes. So in Engine project my goal was to learn how engines work, try to repeat one for educational purposes, to  see possible implementation options used in real projects and improve my hard skills as C++ programmer.

There will be games on it soon
