# StillAlive
StillAlive is a 2D roguelike game made from scratch within the pet project.

This pet project was developed for educational purposes to gain knowledge about the operation of game engines and experience in game development.

Engine:
I was interested in developing the game from scratch, so I didn't use an off-the-shelf engine. The engine on which the game is made is based on the Hazel engine owned by The Cherno Studio https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel. During my training, I coded the engine from scratch by watching Cherno videos and repeating the things I needed with some changes. Unlike Hazel, this engine uses SFML instead of OpenGL to make the task easier.

Still Alive:
The game is completely developed by me without using other people's code.
