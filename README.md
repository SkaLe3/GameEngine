# Engine:
I was interested in developing the game from scratch, so I didn't use an off-the-shelf engine. This engine is a copy Hazel engine owned by The Cherno Studio https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel. During my learning, I coded the engine from scratch by watching Cherno videos and learning it and repeating the things I needed with small own changes. So my goal was to learn how basic engines work, try to repeat one for educational purposes, to  see possible implementation options used in real projects and improve my hard skills as C++ programmer.
