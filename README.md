# About StillAlive
StillAlive is a 2D roguelike game made from scratch within the pet project.

This pet project was developed for educational purposes to gain knowledge about the operation of game engines, get experience in game development and get better at C++ programming.

# Engine:
I was interested in developing the game from scratch, so I didn't use an off-the-shelf engine. The engine on which the game is made is based on the Hazel engine owned by The Cherno Studio https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel. During my training, I coded the engine from scratch by watching Cherno videos and learning it and repeating the things I needed with own changes. So in Engine project my goal was to learn how engines work, try to repeat one for educational purposes, to  see possible implementation options used in real projects and improve my hard skills as C++ programmer.

# Still Alive:
